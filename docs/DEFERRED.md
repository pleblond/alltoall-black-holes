# Deferred derivations (v5+)

Single tracker for open derivations deliberately **not** claimed in v5.
Each item: what is missing, why it matters, what would close it.
Honesty ledger in `paper/v5/supplement.tex` S1 points here.

## D1 — Evaporation isometry V_k (Page/QES) — P0 next cycle

**Missing:** unitary/isometric evaporation map from graph dynamics:
`V_k: H_graph,k -> H_graph,k-1 ⊗ H_leg`.
Current status: `k -> k-1` surgery is imposed; `S_rad = min(t, Neff-t)`
with 0.72-bit dip is imposed/sampled (`evaporation`, `haar`); QES crossing
is a two-saddle competition + discrete min-cut analogue (`qes`), not
`S_gen = A/4G + S_matter` extremized from a gravitational path integral.
Update (PR #10): the qubit-toy instance is closed — `evaporation_unitary`
(D2) constructs per-step `V_t`, proves `V†V=I` (incl. a composed-map
inner-product test), and computes `S_rad` from `rho_rad` (tracks Haar/Page
to 0.002 bits; all:all circuits converge by depth ~5). What remains is the
graph instance: derive `V_k` from graph dynamics, not merely choose one.

**Close criterion (graph instance):** derive (not choose) a scrambling `V_k`
from the graph Hamiltonian/adjacency; show the reduced radiation spectrum
follows the claimed Page curve under all:all dynamics. Then "Page curve is
a theorem of graph dynamics".
Update (this branch): graph instance closed at small-`N` ED level —
`graphvk` derives per-step `V_k = exp(-i H_graph dt)` from the hole adjacency
(disordered Heisenberg, one random XYZ term per edge), proves `V†V=I` (incl.
a composed-map inner-product test), computes `S_rad` from `rho_rad`, and shows
all:all tracks exact Page (mean dev < 0.25 bits at `N = 8`, typically ~0.01)
while the same `dt` on a chain sags below Page (mean dev > 0.4); changing the
graph changes `V` (`||U_complete - U_chain|| > 1`, `is_adjacency_sensitive`).
Fig 74b. What remains: large-`N`/thermodynamic limit, `k`-backreaction on the
interior spectrum, emission energy/mass spectrum, and `S_gen` extremization
from a gravitational path integral (QES still two-saddle + min-cut analogue).

**Kill relevance:** none currently (no observed BH Page curve); referee
honesty issue, not a falsifier.

## D2 — Kerr multipoles from the graph — P1 next cycle

**Missing:** derivation of spin-induced quadrupole `M2 = -M a^2`,
frame dragging `g_tφ`, `r_ISCO(M,J)`, Kerr QNM spectrum from graph dynamics.
Current status: only Kerr-Newman area `A(M,a,Q)` is assumed to set
`k_eff = A/4ln2` (`kerr`, `kerrpage`); overtone toy is Schwarzschild-like.

**Close criterion:** derive `Q = -M a^2 (1 + δ_Q)` without assuming Kerr;
compare `δ_Q` to GW241011 (`|δ_Q| ≳ 0.17` ruled out at symmetric-combination
level; factor ~2 resp. ~10% by parametrization, LIGO-P2500402).

**Kill relevance:** future wire (see v5 kill table "Kerr quadrupole").
GW250114 (LIGO-P2500421, SNR 80 area law + Kerr ringdown) and GW241011 are
currently consistent by construction, not passed predictions.

## D3 — κ -> c2 map (2PN) — ongoing, narrowed

**Missing:** WHY power-law `|κ| ~ r^-p` implies the metric exponent in
`g_rr = (1+U)^2p` (analytic kappa -> metric map); power-law vs `1/r^2`
disagree cross-applied. See supplement S4 / BU. Kill wire
`p = 0.92 ± 0.056` held to N=16000 (kept as-is; now understood as
conservative ~0.8σ_ω̇ after the erratum below).
Update (this branch): `c2 = p(2p-1)` promoted from ansatz to EXACT theorem
of the `g_rr` ansatz (complex-step series extraction, `twopn`); the ansatz
is now only the `g_rr` FORM plus the kappa -> metric bridge itself.
Erratum (this branch, on record): the J0737 per-unit-c conversion was
`8.9e-5 = dot_dir/C1_GR`; the rescale needs per-unit-c_tot
`dot_dir/C_TOT_GR = 3.55e-5`. Required precision `0.028 -> 0.070`, margin
`5x -> 12.7x`, direct residual `0.24σ -> 0.10σ` (self-consistent `0.09σ`
unaffected — that path never used the conversion). Headline `0.1σ` stands.

## D4 — β(N), w from geometry — ongoing, narrowed

**Missing:** bridge exponent `β(N)` first-principles drift (log-linear over
6 points, recalibrated per N) and `w` from the graph Laplacian /
Damour-Schafer from wiring (the geodesic-sensitivity route is queued).
Update (this branch): `w` documented in closed form
`(c1m-c1g)/(c2g-c2(p))` of the measured inputs (`twopn.w_closed_form`);
empirical construction -> p maps measured at N = 300 (`twopn`, Fig 66b):
`p(beta)` is a steep clean control curve (load-bearing knob,
`beta_for_p(0.92) ≈ 1.48`), while `p(slope)` is flat within noise — the
fitted 0.015 gradient slope is NOT load-bearing. The empirical `β` law is
N-conditional (drift with N still to derive).

## D5 — NICER M-R-Λ + tidal deformability — P1

**Missing:** `R_1.4`, `M-R`, tidal `Λ` from routing stiffness.
Sharpest near-term test after kilonova rate (2-3 yr timeline).

## D6 — Mass-radius from wiring — long-term

**Missing:** `R_s = 2M` (BM reduction: `k(M)` iff `R_s(M)` given).
Single GR input; derivation from wiring alone open.

## D7 — Kilonova radiative transfer — analytic systematics done, full RT queued

**Update (round 4):** analytic viewing/opacity/dust systematics shipped
(`massgaps.gw190814_*_sys`, `gw190814_systematics_table`, Fig 75b, 9 tests):
POSSIS-inspired viewing (equatorial +1.25 g/+0.5 i) + Arnett opacity
rescaling bound the hiding window (equatorial + κ_blue=2 → P~0.18).
**Still missing:** full 3D POSSIS (morphology, Ye-dependent opacities,
reprocessing); i-band direct not claimed (one-zone κ=10 over-traps).
g-band verdicts robust; gap-KN ~1/yr O5 prediction stands.

## D8 — Shedding efficiency ε(M,a) + upper-gap assignment — P1

**Missing:** derivation of the shedding efficiency's mass, spin, and
mass-ratio dependence from graph dynamics. Current status: `M_ej =
0.0168 M_tot` exactly universal (shed fraction 0.168 × 10% efficiency,
both fixed once on AT2017gfo; `collapse`, `massgaps`). Mass and
q-independence are extrapolated, not derived — the highest-value attack
surface on the universal (BBH) transient prediction.

**Close criterion:** derive `ε(M,a,q)` from `K_max(N)` combinatorics,
spin-ordered reabsorption, or remnant-trap physics with the shutoff
location (if any) as output, not input. A derived shutoff between gap
and BBH masses must land where it lands; inserting it at any observed
scale is refused (same rule as the 44 M☉ graph null).
Update (this branch): mass-ratio SHAPE + mass independence derived —
`mergershed` gets `frac(q) = η·2q/(1+q)²` from cross-bond counting with
`1/N` dilution forced by extensivity + all:all symmetry (monogamy
displaces `dS/s_leg` legs; `N` cancels). One calibration `η = 0.336`
replaces `e_final` (anchor `frac(1) = 0.168`); `η < 1` predicted and held;
`ε = 0.1` stays an astrophysics input. GW190814 dims ~0.4 mag vs the flat
prescription but stays kilonova-bright (`M_ej ≈ 0.157 M☉`); the flat
`collapse` law is kept as the O5 falsifier and the sample adjudicates
flat-vs-shaped (Fig 68b). Still open: `ε(M,a)` shutoff derivation.

**Related (not deferred — answered):** no graph feature at the
pair-instability edge. `k(M)` zero curvature, smooth spin/Love running,
He-core χ ~ 1e-8 (`massgaps`): the ~44 M☉ boundary belongs to
stellar/nuclear physics. Negative prediction, main text.
